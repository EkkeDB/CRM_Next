OAuth 401 Authentication Error Analysis
=======================================

Error Message:
API Error: 401 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"authentication_error","message":"OAuth authentication is currently not allowed for this organization."}}

Root Cause:
-----------
The error indicates that OAuth authentication has been disabled or restricted at the organization level. This is likely occurring because:

1. **Organization-Level Restriction**: The organization's Anthropic account has OAuth authentication disabled in their settings.

2. **Security Policy**: The organization may have implemented a security policy that restricts OAuth authentication as a security measure.

3. **Account Type Limitation**: The current account type (possibly a trial or restricted account) may not support OAuth authentication features.

4. **API Configuration**: The API endpoint being used may not be configured to handle OAuth authentication for this specific organization.

Solutions:
----------
1. **Contact Administrator**: Reach out to the organization's administrator to enable OAuth authentication in the account settings.

2. **Use Alternative Authentication**: Switch to using standard username/password authentication or API keys if OAuth is not available.

3. **Check Account Permissions**: Verify that the current account has the necessary permissions to use OAuth authentication.

4. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists, contact Anthropic support to clarify the authentication restrictions for the organization.
