WHY YOU'RE MISSING MENU ITEMS IN DASHBOARD
==========================================

ISSUE: Dashboard sidebar only shows 6 items instead of all available pages

CURRENT SIDEBAR ITEMS (in /frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx):
- Dashboard
- Contracts  
- Counterparties
- Traders
- Reports
- Settings

MISSING ITEMS (Pages exist but not in sidebar menu):
- Commodities (/dashboard/commodities)
- Commodity Groups (/dashboard/commodity-groups) 
- Commodity Subtypes (/dashboard/commodity-subtypes)
- Commodity Types (/dashboard/commodity-types)
- Currencies (/dashboard/currencies)
- Additives (/dashboard/additives)
- Analytics (/dashboard/analytics)
- Contacts (/dashboard/contacts)
- Cost Centers (/dashboard/cost-centers)
- Delivery Formats (/dashboard/delivery-formats)
- Incoterms (/dashboard/icoterms)
- Sociedades (/dashboard/sociedades)
- Trade Operation Types (/dashboard/trade-operation-types)

ROOT CAUSE:
The sidebar component (Sidebar.tsx) has a hardcoded menuItems array with only 6 items (lines 24-31). 
All the missing pages exist as files in /frontend/src/app/dashboard/ but they're not included in the menuItems array.

SOLUTION:
To see all menu items, the menuItems array in Sidebar.tsx needs to be expanded to include all the missing pages with their respective routes, labels, and icons.

CURRENT STATE: 
- Pages are accessible by direct URL navigation
- Pages are not visible in sidebar navigation
- No technical issues, just incomplete menu configuration

WHY /contracts LOSES SIDEBAR AND TOPBAR
======================================

ISSUE: Accessing http://localhost:3000/contracts shows no sidebar/topbar

ROOT CAUSE - DIFFERENT FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- /contracts page is located in: /frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/contracts/page.tsx
- /dashboard pages are located in: /frontend/src/app/dashboard/[page]/page.tsx

LAYOUT DIFFERENCES:
- Dashboard pages inherit layout from: /frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx (includes Sidebar + Header)
- Contracts page in (authenticated) folder has NO layout.tsx file in that folder
- Falls back to root layout.tsx which only provides basic HTML structure (no sidebar/header)

FOLDER STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
/frontend/src/app/
├── (authenticated)/contracts/page.tsx ← NO LAYOUT = No sidebar/topbar
├── dashboard/layout.tsx ← HAS LAYOUT = Includes sidebar/topbar
├── dashboard/contracts/page.tsx ← Uses dashboard layout
└── layout.tsx ← Root layout (basic HTML only)

FIX NEEDED:
Either:
1. Move /app/(authenticated)/contracts/ to /app/dashboard/contracts/ (but already exists)
2. Create layout.tsx in /app/(authenticated)/ folder with sidebar/topbar
3. Use the existing /dashboard/contracts page instead

CURRENT DUPLICATE:
- /contracts (no layout) - located in (authenticated) folder
- /dashboard/contracts (with layout) - located in dashboard folder

WHY SIDEBAR LINKS GO TO WRONG ROUTES
===================================

ISSUE: Sidebar links point to root routes instead of /dashboard/ routes

CURRENT SIDEBAR LINKS (in Sidebar.tsx lines 24-31):
- Dashboard → /dashboard ✓ (correct)
- Contracts → /contracts ✗ (should be /dashboard/contracts)
- Counterparties → /counterparties ✗ (should be /dashboard/counterparties)  
- Traders → /traders ✗ (should be /dashboard/traders)
- Reports → /reports ✗ (should be /dashboard/reports)
- Settings → /settings ✗ (should be /dashboard/settings)

ROOT CAUSE:
The menuItems array in Sidebar.tsx has hardcoded hrefs that point to root paths like '/counterparties' instead of '/dashboard/counterparties'. This causes:
1. Loss of sidebar/topbar when clicking menu items
2. Navigation to pages without proper dashboard layout
3. Inconsistent user experience

ACTUAL PAGE LOCATIONS:
- /frontend/src/app/dashboard/counterparties/page.tsx (with layout)
- /frontend/src/app/dashboard/traders/page.tsx (with layout)  
- /frontend/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx (with layout)
- /frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx (with layout)
- etc.

CLAUDE CODE PROMPT TO FIX THESE ISSUES
=====================================

Hey Claude Code, I need you to fix two main issues in my NextCRM dashboard:

ISSUE 1: Missing sidebar menu items
- Currently only 6 items show in sidebar: Dashboard, Contracts, Counterparties, Traders, Reports, Settings
- But I have 19 dashboard pages available in /frontend/src/app/dashboard/
- Missing items: commodities, commodity-groups, commodity-subtypes, commodity-types, currencies, additives, analytics, contacts, cost-centers, delivery-formats, icoterms, sociedades, trade-operation-types

ISSUE 2: Wrong sidebar link routes
- Sidebar links point to root routes (e.g., /counterparties) instead of dashboard routes (e.g., /dashboard/counterparties)
- This causes loss of sidebar/topbar when clicking menu items
- Pages exist in /dashboard/ folder but sidebar doesn't link to them correctly

ISSUE 3: Inconsistent layout behavior
- /dashboard/* pages have sidebar + topbar (correct)
- Root route pages have no sidebar/topbar (incorrect)
- There's a duplicate contracts page in (authenticated) folder

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

1. UPDATE SIDEBAR NAVIGATION:
   - Edit /frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
   - Fix existing menuItems array (lines 24-31) to use /dashboard/ prefix for ALL items
   - Add ALL missing dashboard pages to menuItems array
   - Add proper icons for each new menu item
   - Organize menu items logically (group related items together)

2. FIX LAYOUT CONSISTENCY:
   - Remove duplicate contracts page from /frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/contracts/
   - Ensure all dashboard functionality uses /dashboard/* routes with proper layout
   - Update any hardcoded links that point to root routes to use /dashboard/* instead
   - Verify all dashboard pages have consistent sidebar + topbar

3. VERIFICATION:
   - Test that all menu items are visible in sidebar
   - Test that all menu items link to correct /dashboard/* pages
   - Test that sidebar + topbar appear on all dashboard pages
   - Ensure no broken links or missing pages

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Complete sidebar navigation with all 19+ dashboard pages
- All sidebar links point to /dashboard/* routes
- Consistent layout (sidebar + topbar) across all dashboard pages
- No duplicate or orphaned pages
- Clean navigation structure

Please implement these fixes systematically and verify everything works correctly.
